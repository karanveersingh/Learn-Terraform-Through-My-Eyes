# Infrastructure as Code (IaC)

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is the practice of managing and provisioning computing infrastructure (such as servers, networks, and databases) using machine-readable configuration files, rather than manual hardware configuration or interactive configuration tools. 

With IaC, you can:

- Automate infrastructure deployment and management.
- Version control your infrastructure setup.
- Improve consistency and reduce human error.
- Easily replicate environments for development, testing, and production.

Popular IaC tools include Terraform, AWS CloudFormation, and Ansible.
