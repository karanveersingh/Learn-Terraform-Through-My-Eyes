# Why Terraform Instead of CloudFormation?

## 1. **Multi-Cloud Support**
- **Terraform** supports multiple cloud providers (AWS, Azure, GCP, etc.) and other services.
- **CloudFormation** is AWS-specific.

## 2. **Modularity and Reusability**
- **Terraform** modules enable reusable, composable infrastructure code.
- **CloudFormation** has nested stacks, but less flexibility.

## 3. **State Management**
- **Terraform** maintains state files, allowing for better tracking and planning of changes.
- **CloudFormation** relies on stack status, with less granular control.

## 4. **Language and Syntax**
- **Terraform** uses HashiCorp Configuration Language (HCL), which is concise and human-readable.
- **CloudFormation** uses JSON or YAML, which can be verbose.

## 5. **Community and Ecosystem**
- **Terraform** has a large open-source community and a wide range of provider plugins.
- **CloudFormation** is limited to AWS and its ecosystem.

## 6. **Plan and Apply Workflow**
- **Terraform** provides a `plan` phase to preview changes before applying.
- **CloudFormation** does not have a direct equivalent.

**Summary:**  
Choose Terraform for multi-cloud flexibility, modularity, and a strong open-source ecosystem. Use CloudFormation if you are fully committed to AWS and want deep integration with AWS services.
